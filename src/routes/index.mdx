Hey! My name is Jasmin, I'm a web developer from Switzerland.

<b>🦀 Rust</b> and <b>💎 SolidJS</b> are my favorite things to spend my free time with at the moment and during office hours I spend a lot of time writing <b>⚛️ React</b>. <br /> `jasi.dev` aims to become my personal outlet where I showcase cool projects of mine and other things I find interesting. Stay tuned for some blog posts!
