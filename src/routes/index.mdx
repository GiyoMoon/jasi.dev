import Chip from '~/components/Chip'

Hey! I'm a software developer from Bern, Switzerland.

In my free time, I like to tinker around with <Chip type="rust" /> and <Chip type="solidjs" />. During office hours I spend a lot of time writing <Chip type="nextjs" />, a meta framework for <Chip type="react" />. <br /> <span class="font-mono text-fuchsia-600 dark:text-fuchsia-400">jasi.dev</span> aims to become my personal outlet where I showcase projects of mine and share other things I discover. Stay tuned for some blog posts!

**On the web** <br />
Find me on <Chip type="github" />, <Chip type="x" /> and <Chip type="linkedin" />.
